best Intune dashboard using powerBI

Creating an effective Intune dashboard using Power BI involves several key steps and considerations. Here's a comprehensive guide to building one of the best Intune dashboards using Power BI:

## Data Source

The primary data source for your Intune dashboard should be the Intune Data Warehouse. This provides a comprehensive set of data tables with relations that you can use for reporting purposes[1]. To access this:

1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Select "Get data"
3. Search for "Intune Data Warehouse" and connect
4. Authenticate with your account
5. Select the tables you need for reporting[1]

## Key Components

A robust Intune dashboard should include the following components:

### Device Overview
- Total number of devices
- Devices by operating system
- Devices by ownership (corporate vs. personal)
- Device compliance status

### User Overview
- Total number of users
- User adoption rates
- User-to-device ratio

### Compliance
- Overall compliance rate
- Compliance by policy
- Non-compliant devices by reason

### App Management
- App installation status
- App usage statistics
- App versions in use

### Configuration Profiles
- Profile deployment status
- Profile assignment overview

### Security
- Encryption status
- Threat detection metrics
- Risk levels of devices

## Design Considerations

1. Use a variety of visualizations (charts, graphs, tables) to present data effectively.
2. Implement filters and slicers to allow for dynamic data exploration.
3. Use color coding consistently to highlight important information.
4. Create separate pages or tabs for different aspects (e.g., devices, users, compliance, apps).

## Advanced Features

To take your dashboard to the next level:

1. Implement real-time or near real-time data refresh using Power Automate[2].
2. Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for complex calculations and metrics.
3. Incorporate data from other sources like Azure AD or Microsoft 365 for a more comprehensive view.

## Template Option

For a quick start, you can use pre-built templates. Jannik Reinhard, a Microsoft MVP, has created a comprehensive Intune dashboard template that you can download and customize[1][4]. This template includes:

- App view
- Device view
- Configuration profile view

To use this template:
1. Download it from Jannik's GitHub repository
2. Open in Power BI Desktop
3. Refresh the data
4. Sign in with your credentials[1]

## Continuous Improvement

Remember that building an effective dashboard is an iterative process. Regularly gather feedback from users and stakeholders to refine and improve your dashboard over time.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the power of Power BI, you can create a comprehensive and insightful Intune dashboard that provides valuable insights into your device management environment.
